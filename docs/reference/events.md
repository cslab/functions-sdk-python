Events always have a `name` and a `data` attribute. The contents of those attributes depend on the type of the event.


## DocumentCreateCheckEvent
`csfunctions.events.DocumentCreateCheckEvent`

This event is fired when a user tries to create or copy a document. Raising an exception will prevent the creation.
The event is triggered before any field calculations are performed.

**Supported actions:**

- [AbortAndShowErrorAction](actions.md#AbortAndShowErrorAction)

**DocumentCreateCheckEvent.name:** document_create_check

**DocumentCreateCheckEvent.data:**

|Attribute|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|documents| list[[Document](objects.md#document)]|List of documents that are about to be created.|
|parts| list[[Part](objects.md#part)]|List of parts that belong to the documents.|

## DocumentModifyCheckEvent
`csfunctions.events.DocumentModifyCheckEvent`

This event is fired when a user tries to modify a document. Raising an exception will prevent the modification.
The event is triggered before any field calculations are performed.

**Supported actions:**

- [AbortAndShowErrorAction](actions.md#AbortAndShowErrorAction)

**DocumentModifyCheckEvent.name:** document_modify_check

**DocumentModifyCheckEvent.data:**

## DocumentReleaseCheckEvent
`csfunctions.events.DocumentReleaseCheckEvent`

This event is fired when a user tries to release a document. Raising an exception will prevent the release. If the release is done via the express release, the event is triggered before reviewers are notified.
Be aware that the document is not released yet and the release might still be aborted for other reasons (e.g. the reviewers don't give approval), so don't sent the document to e.g. an ERP system yet.
