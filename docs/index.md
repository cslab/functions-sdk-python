## About Functions
This SDK provides the **csfunctions** library for developing Functions with Python.

Functions are deeply integrated in the CIM Database Cloud Webhooks technology. They are designed to work seamlessly together. The goal is to allow implementing custom business logic in a CIM Database Cloud SaaS application without leaving the CONTACT Cloud and without the need to create and maintain a separate infrastructure.

## Requirements

Python 3.10+

csfunctions is build with [Pydantic 2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)

## Installation
Install using pip:
``` sh
pip install contactsoftware-functions
```
